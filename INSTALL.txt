To install python-fmask from the source code bundle, use the following commands

First unpack the bundle. For the tar.gz file, this would be 
    tar xfz python-fmask-0.4.2.tar.gz
For the zip file this would be
    unzip -q python-fmask-0.4.2.zip

The installation uses Python's distutils packaging, so the following commands are fairly standard. 

Build the code
    cd python-fmask-0.4.2
    python setup.py build


If all goes well with that, then install. To install in default locations, just use
    python setup.py install

If you wish to install in a non-default location, use
    python setup.py install --prefix=/yourChosenDirectory

If installed in a non-default location, you will then need to ensure that the right environment
variables are set. For simple bash syntax, this would be something like:
    export PATH="/yourChosenDirectory/bin:$PATH"
    export PYTHONPATH="/yourChosenDirectory/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PATH"

Note that the python2.7 sub-directory needs to match your version of python.
